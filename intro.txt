This repository serves as a testament. It is a storytelling actor, showing in a glance a picture of my journey in learning to code.

Time has flown by, and now I'm writing this as an opening/closing statement.

This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I've acquired, a journey that wouldn't have been possible without the guidance and support of the entire  Codespace team.

Special thanks to my lecturers, who reminded me what it's like to have someone who truly loves teaching and is committed to helping others.

Jorge, John, Ryan, Sharon, and Sam, your hard work was evident throughout this course.  Thanks a lot!

I've improved my coding skills but also learned a lot about teamwork and gained a better understanding of how the tech industry operates out there. This experience has been impactful, and I am grateful for the opportunities and growth  I've acquired.

Thank you all again!
